= Qemu-rb — Ruby wrapper around the QEMU tools

Qemu-rb is a Ruby wrapper around the commandline tools that come with
the QEMU[http://qemu.org] emulator and virtualizer. And no, it does
not depend on libvirt.

This is unfinished stuff. You can experiment with it if you want, but
I don’t guarantee anything.
