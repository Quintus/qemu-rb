  # Loads an existing image without modifying it.
  # == Parameter
  # [path]
  #   The path to the image file.
  # == Raises
  # [RuntimeError]
  #   The image file was not in the +raw+ image format.
  # == Return value
  # The newly created instance

  # Create a new raw image.
  # == Parameters
  # [path]
  #   The path to the file. This will not create parent
  #   directories. I recommend the <tt>.img</tt> file
  #   extension for raw images.
  # [size]
  #   The size of the image file, in bytes. Ensure you have
  #   this much space on your disk, otherwise this will fail
  #   badly.
  # == Return value
  # The newly created instance.
  # == Remarks
  # Depending on the specified size, this may take some time.
